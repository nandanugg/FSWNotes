    <p class="paragraph" id="paragraph-id">Sherlock Holmes, fictional character created by the Scottish writer Arthur
        Conan Doyle. The
        prototype for the modern
        mastermind detective, Holmes first appeared in Conan Doyle’s A Study in Scarlet, published in Beeton’s Christmas
        Annual

        Edwardian
        London, the south of England, and continental Europe. Although the fictional detective had been anticipated by
        Edgar
        Allan Poe’s C. Auguste Dupin and Émile Gaboriau’s Monsieur Lecoq, Holmes made a singular impact upon the popular
        imagination and has been the most enduring character of the detective story.</p>
