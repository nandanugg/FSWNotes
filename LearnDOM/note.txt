to check -> open preview
for image you can ![text](link)
to install live server -> npm install -g live-server
write live-server
the difference between live server extention and
npm is in npm there are display we may be need like
GET/favicon~
click listener -> special for javascript
getElementsByClassName -> collection, means its array
so when its array, we can indexing like array[0]
getElementsByClassName('class') -> class name matter
to get the value -> input.value
if make a script html, declaration must be place 
first, then logic, and parameter
we can also get and set the value
button onclick = () => {
   console.log('button pressed', input.value);
   input.value =""
} 
if we doesnt include index[] will not works ->
uncaught typeerror
alway sremember getElementBy is array that we can
always loop
instead we can loop this if there are 2 p
id will go reference to element
if there are 2 element with 2 same id, it will 
reference to first id
id is more specific than class
