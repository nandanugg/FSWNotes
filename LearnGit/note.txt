branch feature for the first time (login feature)
login feature branch from branch
merge = to take the other branch and take to ours
if feature is done, we must merge it 
-> e.g. merge login [UAT/testing]
memantau if feature is success/jalan or not
after merge login merge dev
so far this is git flow
landing feature = slide slide information
version 1.1.15 to 2.1.15 => 
if there a lot changes
version 2.1.15 to 2.2.15 =>
if there are update feature, hotfix
version 2.2.15 to 2.2.16 =>
