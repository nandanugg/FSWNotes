1. How to install node
- Search in google "install node with nvm" -> look into github nvm sh
- Copy curl~ to windows terminal and ubuntu
- After install reboot (close ubuntu, open again)
- Write in terminal -> nvm install node
- Check if node and npm installed -> node -v



2. Git with application version analogies
Before doing the branching to master, what we need is make another branch first before merge it to maser.
When implementing branch there are feature branch
Alpha app is more lower than beta
master - dev - feature 
Branch feature for the first time (login feature)
Login feature branch from branch
Merge is equals to take the other branch and take to ours
If feature is done, we must merge it 
e.g. merge login [UAT/testing]
So far this is what called git flow
Landing feature = slide slide information
Version 1.1.15 to 2.1.15 => if there a lot changes.
Version 2.1.15 to 2.2.15 => if there are update feature, hotfix.
Version 2.2.15 to 2.2.16 => bug fix, mini update.
If 12.12 was done, do the version decrease? no, we are always changed even feature done. Still cannot commit to our new branch.


3. Git flow
to move another branch = git checkout
Shortcut:
ctrl shift p -> checkout ... to shortcut to branch
ctrl shift p -> merge branch
If using cut will get conflict in each line stash take changes that not yet commit it is when we forget which branch we must have make repository via github.
git is on our pc (local)
To connect to github = git remote add (alias)origin ...url...
git remote shows alias and remote apa aja
