1. Software gui for git
When pushing to github make sure to commit, and refresh github.
software gui = to check what branch is as visual
e.g. gitkraken = commit is where branch is where
e.g. sourcetree 



2. Git flow with github
git pull 
git branch development
git checkout development
git fetch
git pull -> to update changes in github
git fetch -> to update changes from github
Before delete branch in local we must delete it first in github. To delete in github:
git push -d branch name
There are master and origin, origin still on remote or not on local directory
Git makes new branch local automatically when checkout branch origin which is github.
git fetch one way -> is there are any update new in github or not?
git fetch prune two way -> update two remote and git tag like versioning makes commit of branches to give for ex tag 1.1.2
Tag is for tagging each version
git tag usually do in branch master last commit -> git tag v.1.1.2
To push tag in github -> git push --tags (tag hotfix, feature add for example)
to delete git push:
branch -> -D, if feature just -> -d
git push -u origin branch_name
