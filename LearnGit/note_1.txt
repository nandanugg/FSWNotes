when pushing to github 
make sure to commit, and refresh github
software gui = to check apa aja branch as visual
e.g. gitkraken = commit is where branch is where
e.g. sourcetree 
git pull 
lets say delete one of file, commit message
push to click cloud icon
git branch development
git checkout development
git fetch
git pull to update changes in github
git fetch to update changes from github
before delete branch in local we must delete first 
in github
to delete in github git push -d branch name
there are master and origin
origin still on remote
or not on local directory
git makes new branch local automatically
when checkout branch origin which is github
git fetch one way -> is there are any update new
in github or not?
git fetch prune two way -> update two remote and 
git tag like versioning
makes commit of branches to give for ex tag 1.1.2
tag for tagging each version
git tag usually do in branch master
last commit -> git tag v.1.1.2
to push tag in github -> git push --tags
tag hotfix, feature add for example
to delete git push
branch -> -D, if feature just -> -d
how to collaborate:
1 qa responsible of some developers
point for developers: if revision is lesser than 5
point for qa: if revision is more than 5
git push -u origin branch_name
