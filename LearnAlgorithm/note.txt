difference between var and let is
var can be write without var and just variable name
e.g. c = 30
let cant be initiate more than 1 times, will take
syntaxerror -> cant be declare more than 1
let safer than var 
remember const is stand for constant and cant be
change, if we first define const variable like
const bi; -> then will be error
loop -> iteration 
while loop will run until condition is false
usually to find data of array and filter
to input something like rating in seller of 
ecommerce should have input it in string because
when using int conversion seems complicated
for of to display item 1 by 1
word + s/es -> to ez spot the detail of difference
we definitely not console log every problem
instead we save a data to variable and using 
similar with print format with back tick `
to split the file for example js in vscode we can
use split right
for example we want to define new variable = old
variable. then the concept is returning value from
old variable to new variable
funtion is like above but just a bit complicated
function call - function execute - function use
will find where is this functionname(parameter)
and if the function is called then will be input
to parameter so function can process as function
rule
-> addDollarSign(200) -> calling function
-> will be $200 as function rule we define before
const will be write only if we sure we dont want
to change the value of variable
arrow function is not function, its value 
like string
function can be have more than 1 parameter
synchronous and asynchrounous is very different
when synchronous is waiting code to be executed
in order
asynchronous is not waiting instead will be executed
as needed
for example in last code will be execute after
3000 ms so when we call function to get value
we cant because the function get delayed so 
get undefined
method is like siblings of property
remember property have value
method is function that inside object  
when knowing method, in js every value is object
when using string there are method that we can be
modified object/value from variable, store many 
function in one object()
learn how to use something like callback or method
because its really important no need to make
use method when needed
tomorrow will be implement js to website
to practice more -> javascript project ideas
